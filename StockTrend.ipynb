    "In this project we develpped a stock analyzer that uses historical price data from the Yahoo Finance Library (yfinance). In this report we modeled the relationship between the time (days, months, years) and the stocking closing price using a linear regression. Although this report will be demonstrating the result for 3 major stocks over 3 different time periods, our code is generalized for any stock available on the market as long as its ticker is valid on Yahoo Finance. So the goal is to essentially create and fit a line that best fit throughout data points and observe if a real trend exists; and if it does it would be able to inform us on trading decision (Buy or Sell).\n",
